# Symplectic lattice gauge theories in the Grid framework: domain wall fermions and continuum extrapolations––analysis workflow


[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.22307749.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22307749)

The workflow in this repository performs
the analyses presented in the paper
[Symplectic lattice gauge theories in the Grid framework: domain wall fermions and continuum extrapolations][paper].

## Requirements

- Conda, for example, installed from [Miniforge][miniforge]
- [Snakemake][snakemake], which may be installed using Conda
- LaTeX, for example, from [TeX Live][texlive]

## Setup

1. Install the dependencies above.
2. Clone the workflow repository
   (or download and extract the [code release][coderelease] from Zenodo)
   and `cd` into it:

   ```shellsession
   git clone git@github.com:telos-collaboration/2fSp4MDWF_workflow.git
   cd 2fSp4MDWF_workflow
   ```
3. Download the required files, including `ensembles.csv` and `raw_data.zip`,
   from [the data release](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22308547).
   To reproduce the workflow outputs, the repository root must contain
   `raw_data/`, extracted from the archive:

   ```shellsession
   unzip raw_data.zip
   ```

   The `ensembles.csv` file must be placed at `metadata/ensembles.csv`.
   The `external_data/` directory is optional and can be extracted
   from the archive:

   ```shellsession
   unzip external_data.zip
   ```

   After downloading and extracting the required files,
   the expected layout is:

   ```text
   2fSp4MDWF_workflow/
   ├── config/
   ├── metadata/
   │   └── ensembles.csv
   ├── raw_data/
   ├── src/
   ├── styles/
   ├── workflow/
   └── external_data/
       └── wilson_fermions_data/
   ```

   When `external_data/wilson_fermions_data/` is present and complete,
   the workflow uses the included analysis-ready Wilson comparison data.
   When this directory is absent or incomplete,
   Snakemake can recreate those Wilson inputs through the
   `prepare_wilson_analysis_data` rule.
   That rule stages the upstream [Wilson workflow release][Wilson-workflow],
   downloads the [Wilson raw-data release][Wilson-data],
   and requests only the Wilson JSON targets needed by this analysis.

4. If you are running on Tursa or another HPC facility where the production job
   must run without Internet access, prepare the Conda environments on a login
   node with Internet access:

   ``` shellsession
   snakemake --cores 1 --use-conda --conda-create-envs-only
   ```

## Running the workflow

The workflow is run using Snakemake:

``` shellsession
snakemake --cores 1 --use-conda
```

where the number `1`
may be replaced by
the number of CPU cores you wish to allocate to the computation.

There are two possible ways to run the workflow.

1. If `external_data/wilson_fermions_data/` has been extracted from the data
   release,
   the workflow reuses those analysis-ready Wilson comparison inputs:

   ``` shellsession
   snakemake --cores all --use-conda
   ```

   With this directory already present,
   running the workflow with `--cores all` on a MacBook Pro with an
   Apple M3 Pro processor
   (12 CPU cores: 6 performance and 6 efficiency)
   took around 30 minutes.

2. If `external_data/wilson_fermions_data/` is not included,
   the workflow attempts to recreate the Wilson comparison inputs from the
   upstream Wilson releases. This requires Internet access and additional disk
   space. The Wilson workflow, metadata, and raw-data downloads are handled by
   the `prepare_wilson_upstream_inputs` rule using one core. The subsequent
   Wilson analysis-preparation step uses the cores provided to the main
   Snakemake command.

   If the production job must run without Internet access, the Conda
   environments should already have been prepared as described in Setup step 4.
   Then, prepare the upstream Wilson workflow inputs and Julia environment on
   a login node with Internet access:

   ``` shellsession
   snakemake --cores 1 --use-conda external_data/wilson_upstream/fundamental_Wilson_fermion_analysis_2026/intermediary_data/julia_ready
   ```

   This command triggers `prepare_wilson_upstream_inputs`, which downloads and
   extracts the upstream Wilson workflow archive, metadata archive, and Wilson
   raw-data archive (`external_data/wilson_upstream/raw_data.tar`), and then
   triggers `prepare_wilson_julia_environment` to instantiate the Julia
   environment used by the Wilson comparison workflow. Once this is complete,
   the remainder of the workflow can run without Internet access, provided the
   required raw data and external archives are already available.

   One can also force regeneration of the Wilson comparison inputs from the
   upstream workflow by running:

   ``` shellsession
   snakemake --cores 6 --use-conda --forcerun prepare_wilson_analysis_data process_wilson_combined
   ```

   On the Tursa HPC facility, using 6 cores and including the download of the
   Wilson raw data, the same regeneration step took approximately 3 hours.
   The full regeneration of the Wilson data is not supported on macOS.

## Output

Output plots, tables, equations, and definitions
are placed in the `assets/plots`, `assets/tables`, `assets/equations` and `assets/definitions` directories.

Output data assets are placed into the `data_assets` directory.

Intermediary data are placed in the `intermediary_data` directory.

## Reusability

This workflow is relatively tailored to the data
which it was originally written to analyse.
Additional ensembles may be added to the analysis
by adding relevant files to the `raw_data` directory,
and adding corresponding entries to the files in the `metadata` directory.
However,
extending the analysis in this way
has not been as fully tested as the rest of the workflow,
and is not guaranteed to be trivial for someone not already familiar with the code.
